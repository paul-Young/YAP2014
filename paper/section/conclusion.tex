In analyzing the safety issue, we used a similar microscope model to determine the relationship between adjacent cars. This is built upon a discreet realization of the kinematic model to simulate and calculate the situation of overtaking in both ruled and unruled traffic. We were able to draw the conclusion that the ruled traffic is better at reducing the safety threat.
