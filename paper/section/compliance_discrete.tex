In the previous safety model, we assumed that each one follow the suggested rule by setting the following time $t = 2$ and the minimum following distance $d \ge vt$. However, in case of non-compliant drivers, they may shorten the following time, thus the following distance. Suppose those cars has a shorter following distance $d_m'$. Because of their lowered following time, the distance between it and the car in front is almost inflexible. Thus, the wave of slowing down would not be tolerant for those cars. The number of cars involved in wave of slowing down would be $n' = d_m/d_0+\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the number of cars that has shorter following distance $d_m'$. This increase in number of slowing down cars is a potential risk to traffic safety.
