	\section{Interpretation of the Problem}


	\section{Model}
	To simplify the model, we consider a stretch of straight two-lane freeway with no on/off ramp. To assess the performance of the given traffic rule, we would like to analyze its impact on traffic flow, road safety, and ability to recovery from traffic jams.

	\section{Conclusion}

	Apparently, the ruled traffic has the following advantages over the unruled one: it has a higher tolerance to traffic disturbance in heavy traffic. The lessened disturbance if a positive factor for constant vehicle traveling speed. It also better performance in safety. However, it has a smaller traffic flow, especially in the case of light traffic. But, on the other hand, the most severe factor for the traffic flow is existence of accidence. Therefore, the improved safety on ruled traffic is positive factor for the traffic flow. 

	Notice that our model did not have the orientation of fast and slow lanes as a parameter. In this case, the faster/passing lane could be either the right or the left lane. In reality, countries like U.S, China, where people drive on the right side of the road, has mostly freeway exit on the right hand side and exiting the freeway usually involves significant slowing down. Thus, it is reasonable to set the right lane as the slower lane and the left lane as the faster/passing lane so that the faster cars would not be blocked by the slowest car.  However, for countries like Japan and UK, the freeway exit are located at the left hand side, which means the left lane should be the slower lane. In this case, a simple change of orientation would work.
